## Description

This website is designed with Collectors of Star Wars Merchandise in mind. It servers a central forum and hub where users can communicate to create posts for various Star Wars collectibles to share. Users can register a profile with the website, make posts, reply on existing hosts, and use the search feature to find items by category.

## Installation

This program requires Node.js and NPM. Once these are installed, please run:

```
npm init
```
and then
```
npm i
```

## Usage

When the user accesses the website he/she is taken to a landing page with a Login Button. The member can follow this link and then is prompted to either login or create a new username. Once the user is logged in, either as a returning user or by registering for the first time, he/she can then browse all the posts of various Star Wars Collectibles. Each post is given a specific category, so the search feature in the main nav bar can be employeed to search by Category and Username.
